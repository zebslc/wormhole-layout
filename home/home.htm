                <h2>Back for 2018</h2>

                <p>Worthing Wormhole is a local comic con, run by local people on a not for profit basis. We do it because we
                    want to add fun, sci-fi, science and diversity to Worthing. We try and use local stall holders where
                    possible and have booked only local street food companies to cater for us.Wormhole Comic Con is back
                    this year and setting out to become another out of this world events in Sunny Worthing. Something to
                    put in your calendar and Brighton up your November. Last year saw nearly 1000 people attend the fun packed
                    daytime event at the Assembly Room and 250 people enjoy THE party of 2018 at St Pauls. We are back at
                    the same venues this year on November 10th and tickets are already selling fast. </p>
                <p>This year we have taken our core comic con event and added a Gaming St8ion with console games, VR gaming
                    and table top games. We are also adding a huge Cre8ion St8ion zone aimed at families. This will include
                    stage performances, lego workshops, crafting workshops, creative writing, circus skills, face painting
                    and the chance to make your on wand. </p>
                <p>Our event this year sits alongside this years earlier fabulous Harry Potter themed Children's Parade as we
                    have several guest actors from Harry Potter as well as other franchises such as Star Wars and Doctor
                    Who. We also welcome an actress from the Fantastic Beasts sequel which opens on November 16th at the
                    Dome Cinema. </p>
